## v2.5.0 -- 2026-04-23

### dario v3.30.1–v3.31.3 upstream sync

Ported relevant changes from dario v3.30.1 through v3.31.3. Only CC-relevant
bug fixes and fingerprint updates were ported; CLI flags, bounded queue,
Hermes/Cursor/Cline detection, and multi-client features were skipped
(single-user proxy doesn't need them).

**Ported:**

1. **max_tokens pin (v3.30.1)** — CC 2.1.116+ sends `max_tokens: 32000` on
   every request. Our proxy now injects this when the client doesn't set it,
   closing a fingerprint gap where real CC always includes this field.

2. **output_config.effort injection (v3.30.1/v3.31.1)** — CC 2.1.116+ sends
   `output_config: { effort: 'high' }` for non-haiku thinking requests. Now
   injected when missing from the client request.

3. **Verbose 401 logging (v3.31.2, dario#97)** — When Anthropic returns 401,
   the proxy now logs subscription type and token expiry to help diagnose auth
   failures. Header values are never logged (only metadata).

4. **OAuth authorize URL normalization (v3.31.3, dario#71)** — Added
   `normalizeAuthorizeUrl()` that rewrites the legacy
   `https://claude.com/cai/oauth/authorize` to `https://claude.ai/oauth/authorize`.
   CC's binary ships the legacy URL but runtime uses claude.ai directly; recent
   Anthropic-side changes broke the 307 redirect path.

**Evaluated and skipped (not applicable to single-user proxy):**

- v3.30.4: Platform-scoped tool filtering (PowerShell on Windows) — macOS only
- v3.30.5: maxTested bump — internal to dario
- v3.30.6: Tier-1 review feedback — docs only
- v3.30.7: `--preserve-orchestration-tags` flag — not needed
- v3.30.8: `--no-live-capture` + `--strict-template` flags — not needed
- v3.30.9: Bounded request queue — single-user, no concurrency control needed
- v3.30.10: `--effort` flag — we hardcode 'high' matching CC wire default
- v3.30.13: Hermes Agent detection + max_tokens passthrough — OpenClaw only
- v3.31.0: Stability policy — docs only
- v3.31.1: CC 2.1.117 drift patch — already at 2.1.117 since v2.4.3

## v2.4.0 -- 2026-04-20

### dario knowledge port — 10 fingerprint improvements

Ported behavioral fingerprint mitigations from the dario project (v3.30.0) to
close detection gaps that string-level transforms alone can't address.

**New Layers:**

1. **Header ordering (Layer 13)** — CC sends HTTP headers in a specific order.
   Our proxy now reorders outbound headers to match CC's exact wire order
   (accept → content-type → user-agent → x-claude-code-session-id → ...).
   Source: `dario/cc-template.ts::orderHeadersForOutbound`.

2. **Body field ordering (Layer 14)** — JSON key order is observable on the wire.
   Request bodies are now reordered to match CC's field order: model, messages,
   system, tools, metadata, max_tokens, thinking, context_management, etc.
   Source: `dario/cc-template.ts::orderBodyForOutbound`.

3. **Session ID rotation (Layer 9)** — Replaced static SESSION_ID with idle-based
   rotation. Session rotates after ~15min idle + 0-3min random jitter, matching
   how real CC mints new sessions per conversation. Source:
   `dario/session-rotation.ts::SessionRegistry`.

4. **Inter-request pacing (Layer 10)** — Added minimum 500ms + 200ms random jitter
   between outbound requests to avoid machine-speed request patterns.
   Source: `dario/pacing.ts::computePacingDelay`.

5. **Orchestration tag stripping (Layer 11)** — Strips XML-style tags injected by
   agent frameworks (`<system-reminder>`, `<env>`, `<current_working_directory>`,
   `<agent_persona>`, etc.) from messages before forwarding. 15 tag patterns.
   Source: `dario/proxy.ts::sanitizeMessages`.

6. **Billable beta filtering (Layer 12)** — Filters out `extended-cache-ttl-*` beta
   flags that require Extra Usage billing. Prevents 400 errors on subscription-only
   accounts. Source: `dario/proxy.ts::filterBillableBetas`.

**Updated:**

7. **CC version bump** — `CC_VERSION` updated from `2.1.97` to `2.1.114` (matching
   dario's live fingerprint capture).

8. **Stainless SDK version** — Updated from `0.90.0` to `0.81.0` and runtime version
   from Node's actual version to `v24.3.0` (Bun's Node compat version, which is
   what CC actually reports).

9. **CCH computation fix** — `computeCch()` changed from deterministic SHA256(text)
   to random 5-char hex per request, matching real CC behavior. The old deterministic
   hash was itself a fingerprint.

10. **Build tag computation** — Verified our `computeBillingFingerprint` matches
    dario's `computeBuildTag` (same salt, same indices [4,7,20], same SHA256 approach).

11. **Framework scrubbing** — Added Hermes, LibreChat, TypingMind to string trigger
    replacements.

12. **Beta flags** — Added `advisor-tool-2026-03-01` and `afk-mode-2026-01-31` to
    match CC v2.1.114's captured beta set.

13. **Tool mappings** — Added `ollama_web_search`, `ollama_web_fetch`,
    `sessions_yield_interrupt` mappings.

## v1.4.0 -- 2026-04-06

### macOS Keychain support

**Changes:**
- `setup.js` now auto-detects credentials stored in macOS Keychain when no
  file-based credentials exist. Checks service names `claude-code`, `claude`,
  and `com.anthropic.claude-code`. Extracts the token and writes it to
  `~/.claude/.credentials.json` for the proxy to read.
- `proxy.js` includes the same Keychain fallback at startup, so it works even
  if setup wasn't run.
- `troubleshoot.js` checks Keychain as a diagnostic step and reports findings.
- `setup.js` also attempts to trigger a credential write by running
  `claude -p "ping"` if no credentials are found anywhere.
- Updated README troubleshooting section for Mac Keychain edge cases.

**Why:**
Some Claude Code versions on macOS store OAuth tokens in the system Keychain
instead of a file. Users see `claude auth status` showing logged in, but
`~/.claude/credentials.json` is empty or missing. This affected multiple users
trying to install the proxy on Mac.

## v1.3.0 -- 2026-04-06

### HEARTBEAT_OK trigger + missing sessions_* tools + NVM path scanning

**Changes:**
- Added `HEARTBEAT_OK` to sanitization — a newly discovered trigger phrase that
  Anthropic's classifier detects. OpenClaw injects this in heartbeat ack
  instructions; without sanitizing it, all requests fail with "out of extra
  usage" even when the billing block and OAuth token are correct.
- Added `sessions_store` and `sessions_yield_interrupt` to default tool list —
  these exist in OpenClaw 2026.4.x but were missing from the proxy defaults.
- Fixed `setup.js` to scan NVM install paths (`~/.nvm/versions/node/*/lib/...`)
  when auto-detecting `sessions_*` tools. Previously only checked system-wide
  and npm-global paths, causing NVM-installed OpenClaw to fall back to defaults.
- Updated `config.example.json` with all new patterns.

**Why HEARTBEAT_OK:**
OpenClaw's system prompt includes heartbeat ack instructions containing
`HEARTBEAT_OK`. Anthropic's classifier treats this as a third-party harness
identifier. Replacing it with `HB_ACK` and reverse-mapping responses resolves
the billing rejection. Confirmed via binary search on a 103K system prompt.

**Ordering note:**
`sessions_yield_interrupt` must appear before `sessions_yield` in the
replacements array to avoid partial matches (`sessions_yield` matching the
prefix of `sessions_yield_interrupt`).

## v1.2.0 -- 2026-04-05

### Bidirectional reverse mapping + sessions_yield + path-safe replacements

**Changes:**
- Added bidirectional reverse mapping on all API responses
  - SSE streaming: reverse-maps each chunk in real-time
  - JSON responses: buffers, reverse-maps, then sends
  - Ensures OpenClaw sees original tool names, file paths, and identifiers
- Added `sessions_yield` to sanitization (new tool in OpenClaw 2026.3.13+)
- Changed `openclaw` replacement from `assistant platform` (has space, breaks filesystem paths like `.openclaw/`) to `ocplatform` (space-free)
- Added `reverseMap` config option for customizable response-side mappings
- Health endpoint now reports `reverseMapPatterns` count

**Why reverse mapping matters:**
Without it, the model sees sanitized paths (`.ocplatform/workspace/`) in its context and tries to use them for tool calls. The filesystem has `.openclaw/`. Reverse mapping translates responses back so OpenClaw and the filesystem always see original terms.

**Why sessions_yield:**
`sessions_yield` was added in OpenClaw between v2026.3.11 and v2026.3.13. It's a new session management tool for ending the current agent turn after spawning a subagent. Without sanitizing it, requests fail intermittently when conversation history references this tool.

**Wildcard recommendation:**
If your OpenClaw version has additional `sessions_*` tools beyond the 5 listed, add them to your config.json replacements and reverseMap arrays.

## v1.1.0 -- 2026-04-05

### Simplified to verified minimal detection bypasses

**Changes:**
- Removed Claude Code tool stub injection — systematic testing proved tool fingerprinting is NOT part of Anthropic's detection
- Reduced sanitization from 18 patterns to 7 verified triggers
- Updated README with accurate detection documentation
- Updated config.example.json with minimal replacement set

**Verified triggers (the only terms Anthropic detects):**
1. `OpenClaw` (case-insensitive) — the platform name
2. `openclaw` — lowercase variant
3. `sessions_spawn` — OpenClaw session management tool
4. `sessions_list` — OpenClaw session management tool
5. `sessions_history` — OpenClaw session management tool
6. `sessions_send` — OpenClaw session management tool
7. `running inside` — the self-declaration phrase ("running inside OpenClaw")

**Confirmed safe (NOT detected):**
- Assistant names (e.g., "custom assistant name")
- Workspace files (AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, USER.md)
- Config paths (.openclaw/, openclaw.json)
- Plugin names (lossless-claw)
- Individual tool names (exec, lcm_grep, gateway, cron, etc.)
- Bot names (custom assistant nameAssistantBot)
- Runtime references (pi-embedded, pi-ai)

**Testing:** Validated with 478+ real OpenClaw requests on production instance.
